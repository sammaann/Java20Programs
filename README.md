This repository contains 20 Java programs covering essential object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, data structures, and algorithms. Each program is designed to demonstrate core Java features such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, method overriding, constructor overloading, interfaces, sorting techniques, searching algorithms, and more.
